### üìö Book Management
- **View all books** in a responsive table with UUID, title, author, year, and timestamps
- **Add new books** via modal form with validation
- **Edit existing books** with pre-populated form data
- **Delete books** with confirmation prompts
- **View book details** in a detailed modal

### üîç Search & Filter
- **Real-time search** by title or author (case-insensitive)
- **Year filtering** with dropdown of available years
- **Advanced sorting** by:
  - Title (A-Z / Z-A)
  - Author (A-Z / Z-A) 
  - Year (Oldest/Newest first)
  - Recently added (by created_at)
  - Recently updated (by updated_at)
- **Result counter** showing filtered vs total books
- **Clear filters** button to reset search/filters

### üíæ Data Display
- **UUID identifiers** for all books
- **Timestamps** showing when books were created and last updated
- **Responsive design** that works on desktop, tablet, and mobile

## Database Persistence

**üîí Your data is SAFE by default!** The system uses Docker named volumes for persistence:

- **Database data persists** across container stops/starts, system reboots, and Docker updates
- Normal operations like `make restart`, `make stop`, `docker-compose down` **preserve all data**
- Only `make clean` or `make db-reset` will delete data (with confirmation prompts)
- The `restart: unless-stopped` policy automatically restarts containers after system boot

### Database Backup Strategy
```bash
# Create regular backups
make db-backup              # Creates timestamped backup file

# Restore from backup if needed
make db-restore-file BACKUP_FILE=backups/backup_20240806_143022.sql
```

### Testing Data Persistence

To verify your data survives container restarts:

```bash
# 1. Add a test book
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/books \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title": "Persistence Test", "author": "Test Author", "year": 2025}'

# 2. Note the returned UUID, then stop all containers
make down

# 3. Restart everything
make up

# 4. Verify your book still exists (using the UUID from step 1)
curl http://localhost:8080/books | grep "Persistence Test"
```

‚úÖ **Result**: Your book will still be there with the same UUID and timestamps!

## Development

### Local Development Setup

1. Start development environment:
```bash
make dev
```

2. Make changes to the code - both frontend and backend have hot reload enabled

3. Run tests:
```bash
make backend-test
make frontend-test
```

4. Check logs:
```bash
make logs                    # All services
make backend-logs           # Backend only
make frontend-logs          # Frontend only
```

### Database Management

The PostgreSQL database comes with sample data and **persists automatically**:

- **Safe restart**: `make restart` (preserves data)
- **Safe stop**: `make stop` (preserves data)  
- **Access shell**: `make db-shell`
- **Create backup**: `make db-backup`
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Reset data**: `make db-reset` (asks confirmation)

### Testing

Run backend tests:
```bash
make backend-test-verbose
```

The backend includes comprehensive tests for all CRUD operations.

## Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and modify as needed:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Key environment variables:
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string
- `PORT`: Backend server port (default: 8080)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`: Frontend API base URL

## Troubleshooting

### Services won't start
```bash
make clean setup
```

### Database connection issues
```bash
make db-reset
```

### Port conflicts
Check if ports 3000, 8080, or 5432 are already in use:
```bash
lsof -i :3000
lsof -i :8080
lsof -i :5432
```

### View service logs
```bash
make logs
```

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: React 18 with Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Context API, search/filter/sort features
- **Backend**: Go 1.21 with Gorilla Mux router, UUID support, Zap logging, native Swagger/OpenAPI
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15 with UUID primary keys, timestamps, and persistent named volumes
- **Container**: Docker with multi-stage builds and automatic restarts
- **Documentation**: Native Swagger UI with interactive "Try it out" functionality
- **API**: RESTful design with comprehensive UUID-based endpoints and timestamp tracking

## Development & Reproduction

### For Developers
- **Complete Implementation Guide**: See [prompt.md](./prompt.md) for full system specification
- **Project Specification**: See [PROJECT_SPECIFICATION.md](./PROJECT_SPECIFICATION.md) for technical details

### Reproducing This System
If you want to recreate this exact system from scratch (e.g., in a new Claude Code session):

1. Use the complete specification in [prompt.md](./prompt.md)
2. The prompt contains all requirements, code examples, and implementation details
3. Following the prompt will produce the identical system with all features

## Contributing
